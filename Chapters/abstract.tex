\section*{Abstract}
This thesis covers the design and implementation of a peer-to-peer teaching
network. The primary goals is to use cutting-edge technology in order to create
a social network and to explore unconventional virtual learning techniques.
One of the secondary goals of the system is to make it standard-based, web-only,
and so to make it accessible, and independent of proprietary technology.

The application is released under a Free Software license, under the terms of
\href{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html}{AGPLv3}. The code can be
downloaded from \href{https://gitorious.org/discite/discite/}{Gitorious}, and
used without restrictions by universities,high schools or individuals. Ruby and
the Ruby on Rails framework is used, as is JavaScript. The application was
developed and tested under a GNU/Linux environment, but it doesn't have any hard
dependencies on this particular system. Other Unix-like operating systems (MacOS,
Solaris, FreeBSD) are expected to run the program just fine. Deployment scripts
and documentation are provided.

An instance of the application is running at \url{http://discite.info}. The
name of the application, ``Discite", means ``to learn" in Latin.
